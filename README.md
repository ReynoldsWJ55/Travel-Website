# Basic Travel Website Project

In my first project I created a static website using HTML5 and CSS3 for a fictional travel company operating in Namibia.

[Travelly Namibia](https://travellynamibia.netlify.app)

## First Steps

- Created repository on GitHub
- Created HTML and CSS pages

## Second Steps

- Deployed page to Netlify using continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflow
- Integrated Netlify form feature to support backend form submission
